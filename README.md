# Calorie Calculator 
This desktop app calculates a users Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).

## Installation
There is a .exe file readily available so no installation is required

## Contributions
It was built using the .NET Framework ver. 4.8 and Windows Form.NET, so this app will only work on Windows platforms.
Besides the executable, I have uploaded all the project files necessary so that other's can easily modify or change this project to their liking
